1. ELF Magic numbers are at the beggining bytes of a file, and are used to mark that file as being of an elf type. The elf magic numbers are defined on line 83 - 86 in kern/include/elf.h  as ELFMAG[0..3] 0x7f, E, L, F.

2. UIO_USERISPACE contains the instructions for user processes. UIO_USERSPACE refers to the location of user process data. UIO_SYSSPACE should be used when the source or destination of the memory tansfer are in the kernel space. 

3. The memory is loaded at a virtual address. The uio struct contains a pointer to the virtual address, and therefore the struct can be stored on the stack.

4. vfs_close() must be called so that another process or thread can execute the same program in that file.

5. mips_usermode() in kern/arch/mips/locor/trap.c is called to change into user mode. The function itself is machine independent as it calls functions (for instance to turn off interrupts) whose implementation could change for different architectures. 

6. copyin() and copyout() are defined in kern/vm/copyinout.c. memmove() is defined in common/libc/string/memmove.c. Copyin/copyout copy data from kernel addresses to user addresses (or vice versa) . Therefore, copyin/copyout functions need to make sure need to make sure that user pointers are not accessing off limit addresses, something memove() does not do.
